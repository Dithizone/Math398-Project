# PNNL-Project
  This is a repository for the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory radiation simulation data for use by a team of helpless CSU Channel Islands students.
  
  The data is SpectraMatrix.csv and our Jupyter Notebook for analyzing the data is PNNL_Analysis.ipynb. When I tried uploading/downloading between GitHub and Pycharm directly, PyCharm contributed the ".idea" folder and I'm not quite sure what it does.
